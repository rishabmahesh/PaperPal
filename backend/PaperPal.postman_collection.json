The excessive storage demands not only stress the capacity of the underlying storage and communications systems, but also seriously limit the speed of volume rendering due to data movement and manipulation. A novel volumetric data visualization scheme is proposed and implemented in this work that renders 2D images directly from compressed 3D data sets. The novelty of this algorithm is that rendering is performed on the compressed representation of the volumetric data without pre-decompression. As a result, the overheads associated with both data movement and rendering processing are significantly reduced. The proposed algorithm generalizes previously proposed whole-volume frequency-domain rendering schemes by first dividing the 3D data set into subcubes, transforming each subcube to a frequency-domain representation, and applying the Fourier projection theorem to produce the projected 2D images according to given viewing angles. Compared to the whole-volume approach, the subcube-based scheme not only achieves higher compression efficiency by exploiting local coherency, but also improves the quality of resultant rendering images because it approximates the occlusion effect on a subcube by subcube basis.\", \"Author_Keywords\": null, \"Track\": \"Vis\", \"Award_Type\": null, \"Award\": false, \"Number_Authors\": 5.0, \"Number_references\": 16.0, \"Times_Cited\": 5.0, \"IEEE_Keywords\": \"Image coding,Rendering (computer graphics),Data visualization,Fourier transforms,Nuclear magnetic resonance,Helium,Computer science,Stress,Communication systems,Frequency conversion\", \"Authors\": [\"Tzi-Cker Chiueh\", \"Chuan-Kai Yang\", \"Taosong He\", \"Hanspeter Pfister\", \"Arie E Kaufman\"]}, {\"Paper_ID\": 745330.0, \"Title\": \"Task-specific visualization design: a case study in operational weather forecasting\", \"Date_Published\": 1998.0, \"Abstract\": \"Efforts to create highly generic visualizations, both content and interface, often when applied to non research oriented or operational activities are composed of several goals.

We found that three activities were central to the iterative visualization construction process: data attribute selection, visual template selection, and visual mapping specification. The major barriers faced by the participants were translating questions into data attributes, designing visual mappings, and interpreting the visualizations. Partial specification was common, and the participants used simple heuristics and preferred visualizations they were already familiar with, such as bar, line and pie charts. We derived abstract models from our observations that describe barriers in the data exploration process and uncovered how information visualization novices think about visualization specifications.

Since the use of interactive visualization is optional rather than mandatory, this leaves a \\u201cvisualization gap\\u201d during initial exploratory analysis that is the onus of visualization researchers to fill. In this paper, we explore areas where visualization would be beneficial in applied research by conducting a design study using a novel variation on contextual inquiry conducted with professional data analysts. Based on these interviews and experiments, we propose a set of interactive initial exploratory visualization guidelines which we believe will promote adoption by this type of user.\", \"Author_Keywords\": \"Data science,visualization,visual analytics,contextual inquiry,semi-structured interviews\", \"Track\": \"VAST\", \"Award_Type\": null, \"Award\": false, \"Number_Authors\": 2.0, \"Number_references\": 62.0, \"Times_Cited\": 8.0, \"IEEE_Keywords\": \"Data visualization,Data science,Tools,Visualization,Big Data,Interviews\", \"Authors\": [\"Andrea Batch\", \"Niklas Elmqvist\"]}]"

We have assembled a group of panelists to debate and perhaps reach concensus on the top problems in visualization that still need to be explored.
